Master config:
{{toon:{"name":"full_strategy","symbol":"SOLUSDT","bias_source":"fear_greed","technicals":["RSI","MACD"],"rsi":{"overbought":70,"oversold":30},"macd":{"signal":"histogram_cross"},"position_rules":{"max_open":1,"allow_same_direction_repeat":false},"safety":{"max_consecutive_non_exit":3}}}}

STRATEGY LOGIC:

Step 1 — Sentiment Bias (from Fear & Greed fetch):
  - 0–30: Favor LONG only
  - 31–50: Lean LONG, allow neutral
  - 51–74: Lean SHORT, allow neutral
  - 75–100: Favor SHORT only

Step 2 — Technical Confirmation (from chart):
  - LONG confirmed: RSI < {{rsi_os}} turning up + MACD positive cross
  - SHORT confirmed: RSI > {{rsi_ob}} turning down + MACD negative cross

Step 3 — Position Check (from trigger_history):
  - If last action was LONG or SHORT → must EXIT before new entry
  - If {{trigger_history}} shows {{max_repeat}} or more signals without EXIT → HOLD

Step 4 — Decision:
  - Sentiment and technicals agree → take signal
  - Sentiment and technicals disagree → HOLD
  - Open position with exit signal → EXIT
  - Open position without exit signal → HOLD
  - No position and no clear signal → HOLD
